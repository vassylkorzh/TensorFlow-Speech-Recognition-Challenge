# TensorFlow-Speech-Recognition-Challenge
Kaggle competition
* We might be on the verge of too many screens. It seems like everyday, new versions of common objects are “re-invented” with built-in wifi and bright touchscreens. A promising antidote to our screen addiction are voice interfaces. But, for independent makers and entrepreneurs, it’s hard to build a simple speech detector using free, open data and code. Many voice recognition datasets require preprocessing before a neural network model can be built on them. To help with this, TensorFlow recently released the Speech Commands Datasets. It includes 65,000 one-second long utterances of 30 short words, by thousands of different people.

In this competition, you're challenged to use the Speech Commands Dataset to build an algorithm that understands simple spoken commands. By improving the recognition accuracy of open-sourced voice interface tools, we can improve product effectiveness and their accessibility.
